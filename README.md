## About
I am a business analyst and startup consultant who combines strategic planning with data-driven execution. I help companies shape ideas into business plans, define market positions, and deliver measurable results.
My work spans market research, GTM strategies, financial modeling, and customer segmentation, supported by predictive models and interactive dashboards for real-time decision-making. With training in Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and machine learning, I use AI-based insights to improve targeting and boost conversion rates.

## What I do
I help startups and businesses grow by turning market research and data insights into clear strategies and actionable plansðŸ“ˆ. Furthermore, I work hands-on with tools like Power BI, Tableau, Python, and SQL to uncover opportunities, forecast trends, and guide smart business decisions.

*Iâ€™ve played a variety of roles, from digging deep into market data to developing macro business strategies. Each role has taught me something new about turning numbers and insights into real results.*
