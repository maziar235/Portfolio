## About
I’m a business analyst and consultant with a passion for helping companies grow through a mix of strategic planning and data-driven insight. My experience spans startup strategy, market research, customer journey design, and sales optimization. I’ve worked with early-stage companies to design go-to-market plans, build clear value propositions, and identify untapped market opportunities. On the analytical side, I create predictive models, build dashboards, and extract insights from complex datasets to guide decision-making. I enjoy the challenge of connecting market realities with business strategy — turning data into clear actions that deliver results. My background in data analytics (trained in Paris) combined with hands-on work in business development allows me to bridge strategy and execution seamlessly.
